## Phases

1. Experiment with environment

- Formulate the problem setup
- Implement toy environment
- Tests desired characteristics
- Try different methodologies
- Decide between realistic simulator or toy environment

2. Design methodology

- Evaluate the experiments
- Move to real simulator if viable
- Keep toy environment if not
- Relate to literature
- Hopefully make contribution
- Decide on an architecture
- Probably fix hyperparameters
- Vary actions, observations, rewards

3. Evaluate approach

- Detailed measurements
- Ablation studies
- Vary hyperparameters
- Compare with baselines
  - Human controlled
  - Rule based
  - Random actions (?)
