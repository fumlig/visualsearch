# search

- We should fix training set size, and do tests with different sizes
- It is not feasible to have an infinite number of environments
- If we restrict training to a finite set, this solves the question about knowing the distribution;
- A fixed number of environments could be collected feasibly without having the distribution being known.
- At test time, zero-shot generalization is averaged

- one bird's eye view
- one classic visual search
- one horizon

- bring back zoom?
- zoom simply oversamples pixels
- moving camera when zoomed in moves it less (= one view width)
- costly to move when zoomed in


1. basic search
2. terrain search
3. complex search
  - try to make attention crucial
  - some procedurally generated texture?
  - we can
  - something with roads?
