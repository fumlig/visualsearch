# Search

- Search for optimum of a function?
- We could for example have a signal that responds to targets
- We want to find optimal points as soon as possible

- People have used RL for optimization

- In a signal x, search for peak y = f(x)
- Both x and y are given as observations
- Also history of observations, position
- View a window of the signal, can change window?
