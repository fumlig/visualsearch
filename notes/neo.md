# Search

- Search for optimum of a function?
- We could for example have a signal that responds to targets
- We want to find optimal points as soon as possible

- People have used RL for optimization

- In a signal x, search for peak y = f(x)
- Both x and y are given as observations
- Also history of observations, position
- View a window of the signal, can change window?

# Search in Familiar Distributions

- what if we allow random access?
- an agent learns to search arbitrary distributions
- actions = indices
- search is well-defined in some sense
- is it nearest neighbor search?

# Track and Search

För:

-

Mot:

- Control theory heavy
- Måste gå över till ny teori
- Skulle föredra att göra en enkel sak väl än en svår sak dåligt
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9369190&tag=1
- Is this feasible with end to end reinforcement learning
- What state and action space do they
