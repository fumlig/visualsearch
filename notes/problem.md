- Visual search for multiple targets
- Environment appearance correlated with probability of target
- Actions translate the agent horizontally or vertically: camera movements are relative, never absolute, and correspond to some cost (time, effort, etc.)
- Instance of [TSP](tsp.md).
- I want to go towards the theoretical direction. How much connection to retain to the original visual search problem?
- Define the problem mathematically? Could be fun. Would likely need some help... And more decisions.
