# Designing the Reward Signal

- It seems like it could be important to give a positive reward.
- For example, if a penalty of -1 is given at each time step, and a reward of +1 is given for a good action,
  the net reward is zero. It seems like this inhibits learning, and that it is better to give a larger reward for the positive action.
