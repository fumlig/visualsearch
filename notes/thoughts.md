- Is there some faulty reasoning present?
- If we have a simulator, we have access to an environment distribution.
- Can we simply use this to make an agent?
- We can for example pick levels from the training set and move to the locations where targets were found in them.
- This does not work in general as there might be unseen environments where targets are far away.
- We can use the generator rules to determine areas but this is intractable in many cases.
- Furthermore, environments might not be generated from some known rule but collected from real-world.
