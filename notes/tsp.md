# TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem)

The problem shares many features with TSP.

- TSP: Given a set of nodes, find shortest path that visits each one.
- Probabilistic TSP: Tours must generalize over multiple problem instances. P. Jaillet, “Probabilistic Traveling Salesman Problems,” Ph.D. dissertation, MIT, 1985.
- Physical TSP: Agents must provide actions in real-time in order to navigate vehicles that obey laws of kinematics. D. Perez, P. Rohlfshagen, and S. M. Lucas, “Monte-Carlo Tree Search for the Physical Travelling Salesman Problem,” pp. 255–264, 2012.
- Partially Observable TSP: Agent sees part of environment.  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7743852
- TSP with Time Windows: Each landmark must be visited during a certain time window. Similar to targets appearing randomly, but the windows are known. All landmarks have to be visited! López-Ibáñez-Blum format: 



# CPP (Coverage Path Problem)

- It is also a CPP (Coverage Path Problem)
- Stochastic: 
- Dynamic: 

# OP (Orienteering Problem)

- Waypoints have different values
- Find some route that maximizes sum of scores
