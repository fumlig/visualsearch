## To do

- Finish results
- Update plots
- Train in camera environment
- Collect metrics for baselines and agents
- Write abstract
- Skruva p√• temperaturen

## Overview

## Reproduce

To reproduce results, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

./run.sh 
```

This will run all experiments that are presented in the report.
Learning information is written to the [results](./results) directory, checkpoints and the final model to [models](./models), and tensorboard logs to [logs](./logs).
