\chapter{Method}
\label{cha:method}

% In this chapter, the method is described in a way which shows how the
% work was actually carried out. The description must be precise and
% well thought through. Consider the scientific term
% replicability. Replicability means that someone reading a scientific
% report should be able to follow the method description and then carry
% out the same study and check whether the results obtained are
% similar. Achieving replicability is not always relevant, but precision
% and clarity is.
% 
% Sometimes the work is separated into different parts, e.g.  pre-study,
% implementation and evaluation. In such cases it is recommended that
% the method chapter is structured accordingly with suitable named
% sub-headings.

In this chapter, the method used is described.
Section \ref{sec:problem} formalizes the problem solved.
Section \ref{sec:environment} details the environment used to train and test an agent.
Section \ref{sec:algorithm} describes the algorithm used to train the agent.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem}

% and problem formulation

% environment: discrete grid
% observation: subset of grid, equals attention
% action: transform subset of grid, trigger is binary decision telling whether target is found, or whether it should be checked for thoroughly?
% reward: used to achieve correct trigger in few actions

Formally, the searched environment contains a scene with a set of targets.
The scene is described by a Euclidean space.
In the scene, there are \(N\) targets, each described by a subspace.
At any given time the agent observes a subspace of the scene, which we call the view.
This observation is given in the form of an image.
Through a finite set of actions, the agent can transform its view.
With a final trigger action, the agent can indicate that there is a target in the view.
The goal of the agent is to bring all targets into the view and indicate that they have been found.
This is to be done with a minimal number of actions.
This corresponds to changing the field of perception.

Furthermore, we make the assumption that the agent initially has access to its position.
With this, it can keep track of which regions are and have been in view before.

% "Learning to optimize" has some good formulation tips
% explains that policy search is intractable
% Also uses a decaying step size, could be interesting for us as well
% (although we have multiple targets...)

\section{Environment}
\label{sec:environment}

% overview
To train an test an agent for the problem, we use three environments of varying difficulty.
In each environment there is a scene with a background of distractors and a foreground of targets.
The scenes are drawn from some unknown distribution.
The background and foreground are assumed to be correlated.
This means that by looking at the background, an agent should sometimes be able to deduce a suitable action.
All scenes are assumed to be static in that the actions of the agent do not affect their appearance.

% observations, actions and rewards
The scenes of each environment are discretized into a grid.
We use the same action space, observation space and reward signal for all environment.
The 

% use R^n notation for everything, including distance

To incentivize finding targets quickly, the reward signal is set to -1 for each time step.
Since viewing a window twice is redundant, such actions are punished by setting the reward to -2.
If the agent selects the trigger action when a target overlaps with the window, the reward is set to 5.
When all targets have been triggered, or when 1000 time steps have passed, the episode ends.

% environment 1: easy, understandable
The first environment is the simplest environment. 
The scene is a two-dimensional discrete Euclidean space.
The appearance of the scene is given by a 256x256 RGB image.
The agent observes a 64x64 sub-image at each time step.
In the image there are three Gaussian kernels with random positions.
The height of the kernel is indicated by a higher intensity in the blue channel.
Targets are 1x1 pixels in the red channel.
The locations of the targets are randomized weighted by the height of the Gaussian kernels.
This means that the more intense the blue channel, the higher the probability of a target.
The idea with this environment is to test that the method learns what we want it to learn.

% environment 2: medium, procedural and configurable
The second environment is intended to look like realistic terrain.
The environment has a two-dimensional scene whose appearance is given by a 512x512 image.
Gradient noise is generated and used as a height map.
The height map determines the color of the terrain.
The height also correlates to the probability of targets.
Specifically, targets are located between shores and mountain bases.

\section{Agent}
\label{sec:algorithm}

% self-supervised pretraining?
% https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14323.pdf

In order to efficiently search the environments for targets, an agent needs to be able to learn 

The agent is trained with reinforcement learning using Proximal Policy Optimization with function approximation using neural networks. 

% section 17.4 in sutton is good!

% https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/DeepMimic/index.html

% reward shaping: change reward signal as agent progresses
% could also shape the environment itself, make it more and more difficult
% each modification should be made so that the agent frequently receives reward with its current policy
% this is what we do when we train animals! ie give treats to dogs
% why isn't this working...

% reward normalization: 
% reward clipping: done in "playing atari with deep reinforcement learning": they state that since the scale of scores varies from game to game they fix all positive rewards to be one and negative to be -1. 0 rewards are left unchanged. this limits the scale of the error derivatives and makes it easier to use the same learning rate across multiple games. could also affect agent's performance as it cannot distinguish between rewards of different magnitudes.
% could be important for us if the number of targets and the reward varies a lot

% "explicit episodic (semantic) memory"
% visible region, visited regions
% other semantic information if available
% feature extraction with convolutions
% split the scene into discrete grid
% C channels with different features
% can even be applied to dynamic scenes with a last-seen mask

% could be multiple channels for view as well
% maybe call them "global" and "local"

\section{Architecture}

% resnets?
% https://efficientdl.com/how-to-train-a-resnet-efficiently/

% should use a constant network architecture

The architecture of the neural network is presented in Figure X.

The network is split into three main section: the feature extraction, the shared network, and the policy and value heads.
Like Mnih et al., we use a CNN~\cite{} for feature extraction.
The shared network consists of an LSTM~\cite{hochreiter}.
Finally, both the policy and the value head are two-layer MLPs.

% we should clearly explain the thought process
% connect back to local search problems
% we need a good feature extraction
% and then something for a belief state
% finally, what is the idea behind policy and value (should be in theory instead)

\section{Implementation}

The environment is implemented with Gym~\cite{gym}, and the agent is implemented with PyTorch~\cite{pytorch}. 

% we could give some pseudocode here

\section{Experiments}

The first environment was used to determine a good observation space.
By just observing the current window, the agent can never learn a suitable policy to solve the problem.
This is because it cannot distinguish between equal windows at different locations.
Experiments are run with several additional observation types: window position, ...
Results of these experiments are presented for this environment only.

The agent was trained using the algorithm described in Section \ref{sec:algorithm} for 100 million time steps in all three environments using PPO, PPG and A2C.
Hyperparameters are tuned with random search separately for each environment.
For all experiments, the average return per episode is reported together with the theoretically optimal reward (obtained with an optimal path).
The agent was trained and tested on the full distribution of environments.

With the best performing algorithm we compare three different reward signals.
One gives a constant time penalty of -1 to incentivize finding the target quickly.
The second gives a constant time penalty of -2 and an exploration bonus of +1 when a new view is reached.
The third gives a reward of +1 for moving closer to the target and a penalty of -1 otherwise, as in \cite{caicedo_active_2015}.

Additionally, experiments to eveluate the generalization capability of the agent were conducted.
These were conducted on the procedurally generated terrain environment following the approach suggested in ~\cite{procgen}.
During training, the seed pool size was fixed to various sizes to limit the training set size.
The agent was trained for varying number of timesteps and then tested on the full distribution of environments.
This way, we can get a sense of how much data and simulation is required to use the approach for real-world tasks.

All experiments are conducted on an Intel Core i9-10900X CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU.

For each experiment, we report the mean return and episode length over time during training.
We compare the approach to an exhaustive search and a human searcher with prior knowledge of the characteristics of the searched environments.
As per [rlliable], we report results across multiple seeds.

% select one algorithm and clearly motivate why!
% probably PPO, but why?


% time to find targets could be measured in terms of execution time, 
% and number of timesteps. this way, it could be easier to incorporate 
% visual attention if it is deemed reasonable.

% how do we handle appearance of targets:
% can an agent learn to recognize anything out of the ordinary?
% maybe not the focus, but just the search

% an interesting question is how large search windows we can handle
% could be an alternative to zoom
% a large search window presumably requires attention


% memory is needed for (a) remembering previous locations, and (b) integrating features over time
