% This chapter presents the results. Note that the results are presented
% factually, striving for objectivity as far as possible.  The results
% shall not be analyzed, discussed or evaluated.  This is left for the
% discussion chapter.
% 
% In case the method chapter has been divided into subheadings such as
% pre-study, implementation and evaluation, the result chapter should
% have the same sub-headings. This gives a clear structure and makes the
% chapter easier to write.
% 
% In case results are presented from a process (e.g. an implementation
% process), the main decisions made during the process must be clearly
% presented and justified. Normally, alternative attempts, etc, have
% already been described in the theory chapter, making it possible to
% refer to it as part of the justification.

%When it comes to hyperparameters, we find that letting the number of rollout steps be substantially lower than the episode length we achieve much more stable training results.
%Furthermore, increasing the number of weights in the neural network made it more difficult to train.

%We find that the hyperparameters from [procgen] perform well, especially when the number of environments is large.

%Also, proximal policy optimization was unstable without reward normalization. % Discussion: We hypothesize that this is because...

%This coupled with a sparse reward signal led to many cases where the agent converged towards a poor local optimum (or perhaps never converged at all).


This chapter presents the results for each of the experiments described in Section ~\ref{sec:experiments}.
