\chapter{Results}
\label{cha:results}

% This chapter presents the results. Note that the results are presented
% factually, striving for objectivity as far as possible.  The results
% shall not be analyzed, discussed or evaluated.  This is left for the
% discussion chapter.
% 
% In case the method chapter has been divided into subheadings such as
% pre-study, implementation and evaluation, the result chapter should
% have the same sub-headings. This gives a clear structure and makes the
% chapter easier to write.
% 
% In case results are presented from a process (e.g. an implementation
% process), the main decisions made during the process must be clearly
% presented and justified. Normally, alternative attempts, etc, have
% already been described in the theory chapter, making it possible to
% refer to it as part of the justification.

When it comes to hyperparameters, we find that letting the number of rollout steps be substantially lower than the episode length we achieve much more stable training results.
Furthermore, increasing the number of weights in the neural network made it more difficult to train.
This coupled with a sparse reward signal led to many cases where the agent converged towards a poor local optimum (or perhaps never converged at all).
