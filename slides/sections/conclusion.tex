    \begin{itemize}
        \item Architecture:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Spatial memory architecture scales to larger search spaces and generalizes better.
            \item Temporal memory sufficient (and better) for smaller search spaces.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Approach:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Better than simple baselines.
            \item Comparable to human performance.
            \item Worse than handcrafted baseline.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Why? Stochasticity, local optima, conditions\dots
                % Neither agent was as good as a handcrafted baseline in one of the environments.
                % Why is this? How can we make the agent learn better policies?
                % Stochasticity? Other reinforcement learning algorithm? Too much bias/bad reward signal? etc.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Improvements to approach.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Neural network architecture.
            \item Reinforcement learning algorithm.
            \item Reward signal design.
            % Less bias?
        \end{itemize}
        \item Realistic search scenarios.
        % We have looked at simulated environments which are easier to control.
        % Easier to vary parameters to get a sense of what is feasible.
        % The final goal is to use this for realistic scenarios.
        % There will be higher variance, difficult patterns, detection problems, noise.
        % Should see if this approach scales to such scenarios.
        % Is it enough to simply increase number of parameters?
        % Does the approach has to be modified?
        % Example: use a pretrained object detection network?
        \item Formal verification (for security-critical applications).
        % Handcrafted systems can offer more guarantees.
        % It is important to verify autonomous systems before deploying them.
        % This is especially true for safety-critical applications.
        % Value alignment etc.
