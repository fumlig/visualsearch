    \frametitle{Description}
    
    Learned autonomous search for a set of targets in a visual environment with a camera.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Camera perceives limited region of environment.
        \item Moving camera changes visible region.
        \item Detect when targets are visible.
        \item Locate targets in minimum time.
        \item Learn control from sample scenarios.
        \item Use deep reinforcement learning.
        \item Focus on search paths, simple detection.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Motivation}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Motivation}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Applications in search and rescue, surveillance, home assistance, etc.
        \item Autonomous systems may reduce risk and cost.
        \item Advantages of learning systems over handcrafted ones:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item May find better solutions (deep RL: Atari~\cite{mnih_human-level_2015}, Go~\cite{silver_mastering_2016}, StarCraft II~\cite{vinyals_grandmaster_2019}).
            \item Applicable as long as data is available. % Handcrafted systems have to be designed for each specific environment.
            \item Sufficient to describe problem. % Handcrafted systems must be given a solution, which can be difficult to communicate (subtle visual cues).
        \end{itemize}

\subsection{Aim}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Aim}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Utilize structure in environments:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Books are in bookshelves, cars on roads\dots
            \item Targets can be spread out/close together\dots
        \end{itemize}
        \item Learn distribution of targets from training samples.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Realistically limited training samples available.
            \item Generalize to similar unseen search tasks.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Remember features of explored environment to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Avoid searching regions twice.
            \item Prioritize promising regions.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Questions}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Research Questions}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item How can an agent that learns to intelligently search for targets be implemented with deep reinforcement learning?
        \item How does the learning agent compare to random, greedy, exhaustive and human searchers with prior knowledge of the searched scenes?
        \item How well does the learning agent generalize from a limited number of training samples to unseen in-distribution search scenarios?
    \end{enumerate}
