    \frametitle{Problem Description}
    
    Autonomous search for a set of targets in an environment with a fixed camera.
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Agent observes a limited region of the environment. 
        \item Can direct its gaze and indicate when a target is in view through actions.
        \item Should locate all targets while minimizing the number of actions.
        \item Applications in search and rescue, fire detection, surveillance, etc.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In a random environment with uniformly distributed targets, random or exhaustive search is sufficient.
        \item Most real-world search tasks are not random, but exhibit structure.
        \item Cues in the searched scene can be used to find targets quicker.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Books are in bookshelves.
            \item Cars can be found on roads.
            \item Some targets spread out
            \item Some are close together.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Patterns and cues may be subtle and difficult to pick up.
        \item Manually engineering a searching system with rules can be difficult and costly.
        \item Can a system learn to search intelligently from a set of samples and generalize to similar search tasks?
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Challenges}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prioritize regions with high probability of targets based on previous experience.
        \item Find multiple targets while minimizing path length.
        \item Search exhaustively while avoiding searching the same region twice.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Research Questions}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item How can an agent that learns to intelligently search for targets be implemented with reinforcement learning?
        \item How does the learning agent compare to random walk, exhaustive search and a human searcher with prior knowledge of the searched scene?
        \item How does the agent's ability to generalize to unseen in-distribution environments depend on the number of training samples?
