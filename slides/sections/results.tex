    \frametitle{Preliminary Results}

    Status:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Done with implementation.
        \item Exploratory experiments done, know what seems to work and what does not.
        \item Spatial memory scales to larger search spaces than LSTM.
    \end{itemize}

    Problems:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Many configurable parts (hyperparameters, environment settings, agent architectures).
        \item Long training times, difficult to predict hyperparameter interplay, expensive to tune.
        \item Difficult to design reward signal, magnitudes matter.
        \item Initial problems with scaling up to large search spaces where intelligent search is more important, hopefully solved now.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Future Steps}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Collect results across multiple seeds for all experiments.
        \item Find opponent.
        \item More baselines vs. ablation studies?
        \item Discussion and conclusion.
        \item Tidy up report.
        \item Presentation preparation.
    \end{enumerate}
