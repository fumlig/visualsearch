    \frametitle{Preliminary Results}

    Preliminary results collected for RL agents.
    Have yet to implement coverage agent and 

    Problems:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Many configurable parts (hyperparameters, environment settings, agent architectures).
        \item Long training times, difficult to predict hyperparameter interplay, expensive to tune.
        \item Difficult to design reward signal, magnitudes matter.
        \item Collecting rigorous results across multiple seeds will take time.
        \item Spatial memory approach can handle it.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Future Steps}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Collect complete results across multiple seeds for all experiments.
        \item More baselines vs. ablation studies?
        \item Compare with random, exhaustive and human searcher.
        \item Tidy up report.
        \item Discussion and conclusion.
        \item Presentation preparation.
    \end{enumerate}
