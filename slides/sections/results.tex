    \frametitle{Preliminary Results}

    Status:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implementation done.
        \item Test results collected.
        \item Everything seems to be working.
        \item Agents can achieve episode lengths that are on par with
    \end{itemize}

    Problems:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Many configurable parts (hyperparameters, environment settings, agent architectures).
        \item Long training times, difficult to predict hyperparameter interplay, expensive to tune.
        \item Difficult to design reward signal, magnitudes matter.
        \item Initial problems with scaling up to large search spaces where intelligent search is more important, hopefully solved now.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Future Steps}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Collect complete results across multiple seeds for all experiments.
        \item More baselines vs. ablation studies?
        \item Discussion and conclusion.
        \item Tidy up report.
        \item Presentation preparation.
    \end{enumerate}
